 * CWE: 400 Resource Exhaustion
 * BadSource: fscanf Read data from the console using fscanf()
 * GoodSource: Assign count to be a relatively small number
 * Sinks: for_loop
 *    GoodSink: Validate count before using it as the loop variant in a for loop
 *    BadSink : Use count as the loop variant in a for loop
 * Flow Variant: 53 Data flow: data passed as an argument from one function through two others to a fourth; all four functions are in different source files
