 * CWE: 400 Resource Exhaustion
 * BadSource: connect_socket Read data using a connect socket (client side)
 * GoodSource: Assign count to be a relatively small number
 * Sinks: fwrite
 *    GoodSink: Write to a file count number of times, but first validate count
 *    BadSink : Write to a file count number of times
 * Flow Variant: 62 Data flow: data flows using a C++ reference from one function to another in different source files
