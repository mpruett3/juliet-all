 * CWE: 400 Resource Exhaustion
 * BadSource: fscanf Read data from the console using fscanf()
 * GoodSource: Assign count to be a relatively small number
 * Sinks: fwrite
 *    GoodSink: Write to a file count number of times, but first validate count
 *    BadSink : Write to a file count number of times
 * Flow Variant: 22 Control flow: Flow controlled by value of a global variable. Sink functions are in a separate file from sources.
