 * @description
 * CWE: 319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
 * BadSource: connect_socket Read the password using a connect socket (client side)
 * GoodSource: Use a hardcoded password (one that was not sent over the network)
 * Sinks:
 *    GoodSink: Decrypt the password before using it in an authentication API call to show that it was transferred as ciphertext
 *    BadSink : Use the password directly from the source in an authentication API call to show that it was transferred as plaintext
 * Flow Variant: 72 Data flow: data passed in a vector from one function to another in different source files
