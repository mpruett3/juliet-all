 * @description
 * CWE: 319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
 * BadSource: listen_socket Read the password using a listen socket (server side)
 * GoodSource: Use a hardcoded password (one that was not sent over the network)
 * Sinks:
 *    GoodSink: Decrypt the password before using it in an authentication API call to show that it was transferred as ciphertext
 *    BadSink : Use the password directly from the source in an authentication API call to show that it was transferred as plaintext
 * Flow Variant: 53 Data flow: data passed as an argument from one function through two others to a fourth; all four functions are in different source files
